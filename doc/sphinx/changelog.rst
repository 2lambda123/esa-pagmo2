2.4 (2017-06-09)
----------------

New
~~~

- Initial release of the pagmo/pygmo C++ software-development kit (SDK). The purpose of the SDK is to make the process
  of writing C++ extensions for pagmo/pygmo as easy as possible. The SDK is a beta-quality feature at this time,
  and it is lightly documented - no tutorials are available yet. Please come to the gitter channel and ask there if you are interested
  in it (`#110 <https://github.com/esa/pagmo2/pull/110>`_).

- Improve support for integer and mixed integer optimization (`#115 <https://github.com/esa/pagmo2/pull/115>`_).

Fix
~~~

- Fix a bug in the plotting submodule (`#118 <https://github.com/esa/pagmo2/pull/118>`_).

- Various documentation fixes and improvements.

Changes
~~~~~~~

- pygmo now depends on pagmo, and it is now effectively a separate package. That is, in order to compile and install pygmo from
  source, you will need first to install the pagmo C++ headers. Users of pip/conda are **not** affected by this change.
