C++ Documentation
=================
The full, stand-alone, detailed, documentation of the c++ code.

Core classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^
These are the core PaGMO classes to learn how to use them
we suggest to follow the tutorials / examples.

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  problem
  population
  algorithm

Implemented algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These are the algorithms implemented in PaGMO. They can be used
to solve problems you have implemented or to learn how to use PaGMO to
code your own algorithm

  algorithms/simulated_annealing

Implemented problems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These are the problems implemented in PaGMO. They can be used
to test your algorithms or to learn how to use PaGMO to represent your
problem
