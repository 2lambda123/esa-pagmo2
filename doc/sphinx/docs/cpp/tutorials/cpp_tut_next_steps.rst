Next Steps
==========

Depending on what you want to achieve with pagmo there are different sections where you want to continue.
An overview of the documentation can be found :ref:`here <cpp_api_documentation>`.
A good starting point is to read about the core classes this will help you to gain an overview of the library and its
possibilities (e.g. :ref:`problems <cpp_problem>`, :ref:`populations <cpp_population>`,
:ref:`islands <cpp_island>`, :ref:`archipelagos <cpp_archipelago>`, :ref:`topologies <cpp_topology>` etc.).

If you are interested in applying pagmo to your own problem you can look at the additional user defined problems in
the tutorial section.
Additionally, you can look at the problems implemented within pagmo (in the *implemented problems* section of the
:ref:`documentation <cpp_api_documentation>`.

If you want to go deeper into pagmo and implement your optimizers, islands etc. you should look at the
:ref:`documentation <cpp_api_documentation>` or the advanced topics section of tutorials.
