Bin Packing
===========

The original bin packing problem is ... (**references**)

Since then bin packing has been extended in many different ways: 2D bin packing, 3D bin packing, nD bin packing, ... (**references**)

Problems similar to bin packing can be found in many different domains 
(computer science, logistic, job shop scheduling etc.).

Thus, it is still a very relevant problem with several new solvers being applied/tested/introduced every year. (**references**)

Here we consider a 1D version of bin packing, where we have a set of objects that need to be packed into a set of bins. 
All bins have the same size and the aim is to minimize the number of bins used. The different objects do not have to 
be of the same size.
