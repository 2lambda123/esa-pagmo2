User defined optimizer
======================

In this example we demonstrate how to implement a new optimizer. 
We implement the "*An Enhanced Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm to the Bin Packing Problem*" by Feng et al. 
and will compare its performance against the pre-implemented gaco and ihs optimizers.

For this purpose we will work with the *Bin packing problem* implemented :ref:`here<cpp_tut_bin_packing>`.
